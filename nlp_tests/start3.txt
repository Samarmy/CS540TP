For Block 1,  x is at 5, y is at 4, and z is at 3. Block 2 has a location of 4 7 9.  Block 3 is located at 0 9 4.  For block 4 x is 3, y is 2, and z is 1.  Block 5 has a location where x is 5, y is 9, and z is 1.  Block 6 is located at 4, 4, 3. Trying to model the complexity of the sentences for graphing purposes, I want block 7 to be at 8, 9, 3.  Furthermore, if I make longer sentences, will block 8 still be on top of block9?  I wonder if all these sentences will turn out correctly, and whether block 10 will be next to block8.  I guess its a matter of block11 being at 4 5 6.  It is also probably a matter of whether the code can filter all these extra words, but not filter words like block 12 next to block 10.  Who knows whether this will work, block13 can hopefully go on top of block14, but I'm not sure.  Smaller sentences are good for block13 to go at 1 2 3.  Block 14 should go at a location where x is 8, y is 9, and z is 0.  Derp derp block 15 goes on top of this- block 14 that is.  Do any of these complex sentences work, or will block 16 not make it to the side of block 14.  Finally I will test this, here goes nothing. I need to simplify sentences more, so I am making block 17 at 3 4 5.  Block 18 is located at to 7 8 9.  Block 19 is located at 9 4 2. For block 20 x is at 9, y is at 4, z is at 2.  Block 21 has x equal to 9, y equal to 3 and z equal to 0.  Block 22 goes on top of block 21. Block 23 goes next to block 21.  Block 24 is next to block 23.  Block 25 is at the side of block 24.  Block 26 is on block 24.
