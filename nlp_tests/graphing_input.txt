For Block 1,  x is at 5, y is at 4, and z is at 3. Block 2 has a location of 4 7 9.  Block 3 is located at 0 9 4.  For block 4 x is 3, y is 2, and z is 1.  Block 5 has a location where x is 5, y is 9, and z is 1.  Block 6 is located at 4, 4, 3. Trying to model the complexity of the sentences for graphing purposes, I want block 7 to be at 8 9 3 .  Furthermore, if I make longer sentences, will block 8 be on top of block9?  I wonder if all these sentences will turn out correctly, and whether block 10 will be next to block8.  I guess its a matter of block11 being at 4 5 6.  It is also probably a matter of whether the code can filter all these extra words, but not filter words like block 12 next to block 10, I don't know.  Who knows whether this will work, block13 can hopefully go on top of block14, but I'm not sure.  Smaller sentences are good for block13 to go at 1 2 3 .  Block 14 should go at a location where x is 8, y is 9, and z is 0 .  block 15 goes on top of this- block 14 that is.  Do any of these complex sentences work, or will block 16 not make it to the side of block 14.  I need to simplify sentences more, so I am making block 17 at 3 4 5.  Block 18 is located at to 7 8 9.  Block 19 is located at 9 4 2. For block 20 x is at 9, y is at 4, z is at 2.  Block 21 has x equal to 9, y equal to 3 and z equal to 0Block 36 goes next to block 34.  For block 37, I don't know where I would put it off the top of my head, but when x is 8, y is 9, and z is also 0 would make sense to me.  Also, block 38 goes at x 7, y 9, z 0.  Block 39 should be on top of block 38, please this is imperative.  Block 40 should be next to block38.  Block 41 needs to go where x is 9, I think this is where it goes, and y is definitely 4, and z is definitely 0.    block 43 is an important block, it needs to go on top of block 42 and this is imperative.  Block 44 should also go on top of block 43.  Block 45 location is 8 5 0.  Block 46 needs to go next to block 45.  Block 47 is a red block property.  i completely forgot about block properties in this entire file, so block 48 is also a blue property.  Block 49 is color Burgundy, not like Ron from anchorman, but like the color.  Finally, I'm so happy so be finished writing this, but block 50 needs to be a color of yellow.  Trying to find some failures, block 51 could be above block 52.  Block 53 goes at 1, 2, 3.  Block 54 should be the color of red.  Block 55 should be near the coordinates where x is 5, y is 8, and z is 0.  x is 8, y is 9, z is 0 for block 56.  Block 57 is a color of blue.  Different variations of sentences should help block 58 fail to be above block 59.  Block 59 goes at 4 7 0.  Block 60 should have the same color as block 54 (red).  Block 61 might fail to parse correctly if format the sentence as x, y, z equal to 1, 2, 3.  1, 2, 3 is x,y,z for block 62.  Block 63 is next to the 64 block.  Block 65 is at location six, five, four. Block 66 is at 1,2,3.  1, 2, 4 is x,y,z for block 67.  5, 6, 7 is block 68. 7 is the location for y, 4 is the location for z, 0 is the location for x for the block 69.  Block 70 goes at 4 5 6.
